I want to thank David Oriola Santandreu for his guidance throughout this project, as well as the entire BIOCOM-SC team for welcoming me over these past few months. I also want to express my gratitude to Gabriel Torregrosa Cortés for his help and advice on the development of the code. Finally, I would want to toast all the wonderful people I have met during the master’s. I wish to continue seeing all of you -- even if it’s not on a Thursday. Wishing everyone the best. Moltes gràcies.

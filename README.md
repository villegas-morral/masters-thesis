## Introduction

<sup>[_Return to the Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)</sup>

This repository contains the code, figures, and report of my master's thesis, titled "Agent-based modelling of embryonic organoid development" and developed in 2024 as part of the Master's degree in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. It was carried out at the Multiscale Physics of Living Systems Group, part of the Computational Biology and Complex Systems Research Group ([BIOCOM-SC](https://biocomsc.upc.edu/en)), and supervised by [David Oriola Santandreu](https://davidoriola.mystrikingly.com/). 



## Abstract

<sup>[_Return to the Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)</sup>

In recent years, embryonic organoids have become an increasingly important tool for studying complex developmental processes that are difficult to access in actual animal embryos. These _in vitro_ structures can be generated in a high-throughput manner and have the advantage of mimicking many intricate behaviours observed in real embryos. In this study, we describe an agent-based model designed to simulate the development of embryonic organoids, and implement it using CellBasedModels.jl, the Julia package for multicellular modelling. Our model integrates mechanical interactions with cellular differentiation and accounts for the stochastic nature of both cell-cell interactions and cell fate transitions. We provide a comprehensive overview of the key simplifications made in the mathematical model and offer a numerical justification for these choices. Finally, we use the model to simulate the early stages of gastruloid formation, analysing the roles of cell differentiation and differential adhesion.

## Installation process

<sup>[_Return to the Table of Contents_](#table-of-contents)</sup>

The following instructions provide a guide to set up your computer to run the code, and been tested to work on Linux and Windows.

Download Julia from [their website](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Download version 1.9 and, optionally, set it as default and remove the release version.

```
juliaup add 1.9
juliaup default 1.9
juliaup rm release
```

Run Julia.
```
julia
```
In case 1.9 is not the default version, run
```
julia +1.9
```

Add CellBasedModels.jl and the packages used across the code
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg
julia> add CellBasedModels
julia> add DifferentialEquations, Distributions, Random, GLMakie, Printf, Dates, Glob, NBInclude, MathTeXEngine, IJulia
```
Note that IJulia is only necessary to run the notebooks in Jupyter notebooks. You can use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install). Another option is to use VS Code along with the Julia extension.
